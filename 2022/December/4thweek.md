## What I learned from this week?

#### first collaboration with backend

- eversince I started Hanghae, everyweek of training was all about working with frontend, and it was unclear; what really was going on interms of work flow.
  However, this week changed every perspectives I've had about working with backend, and clearly, it was making much more sense (why we need backend and frontend when we create a project.)

there are couple of things I want to mention interms of our first collab.

1. I finally knew what backend was doing while we are creating bunch of components and UI tags.
2. API is the number one important aspect in collaboration, and frankly speaking, I wasnt able to get a grip.
3. tokens and cookies are must known knowledge when we are dealing with conditional processing.
4. even if I try to accomplish something myself, it's impossible because they are the one who will be checking my request for anything.
5. I need to know how to check my work before I ask anything about fixing their work.
6. to get a better understanding of what they are doing, and bring up my productibity; it's inevitable to learn and practice the node.js
